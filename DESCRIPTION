Description: MRIreduce is an advanced R package designed to convert
        NIfTI format T1/FL neuroimages into structured,
        high-dimensional 2D data frames, focusing on region of interest
        (ROI) based processing. This package incorporates a key
        algorithm called <e2><80><98>partition<e2><80><99>, which
        offers a fast, flexible framework for agglomerative
        partitioning based on the Direct-Measure-Reduce approach. This
        method ensures that each reduced variable maintains a
        user-specified minimum level of information while being
        interpretable, as each maps uniquely to one variable in the
        reduced dataset. The <e2><80><98>partition<e2><80><99>
        algorithm, detailed in Millstein et al. (2020), allows for
        customization in variable selection, measurement of information
        loss, and data reduction methods. NeuroPartitioner is
        indispensable for researchers requiring efficient, accurate
        preparation of neuroimaging data for detailed statistical
        analysis and machine learning applications, enhancing the
        interpretability and utility of neuroimaging studies.
